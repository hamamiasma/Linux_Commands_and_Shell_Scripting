The most common      finding is a non-infectious "HIV retinopathy", characterized by cotton wool spots,      intraretinal hemorrhages, and/or microaneurysms. These changes occur in approximately 50      percent of patients with AIDS. HIV retinopathy alone is not typically associated with      clinical loss of vision, but functional deficits in patients with AIDS without other ocular      complications may be due to this phenomenon.      CMV retinitis has had the most clinical importance of all the associated complications of      AIDS. It is commonly seen in late stage AIDS, and even when treated has the potential to      cause substantial loss of vision. CMV retinitis is also the most costly AIDS-related      opportunistic infection; the mean monthly cost of treatment has been estimated at $7,825.      The incidence of CMV retinitis has varied with changes in the therapeutic and prophylactic      strategies for AIDS and its complications. It has been on the decline in recent years      related to the increased use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART).      Other ocular complications of AIDS such as ocular toxoplasmosis, herpes zoster retinitis,      and pneumocystis choroidopathy occur less frequently than CMV retinitis and HIV retinopathy.      Their frequency has also changed over the course of the AIDS epidemic.      Because the epidemiology of AIDS is rapidly evolving, with HIV becoming more like a chronic      disease, new information is needed on the incidence and course of ocular complications. We      have little information about the effect of HAART therapy over time on changes in immune      status and the risk of ocular complications of AIDS. More information is also needed to      determine who is at risk for developing ocular complications of AIDS, and how treatment is      affecting their visual function, quality of life, and survival.      The Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) is prospective observational      study of patients with AIDS. Patients with a prior diagnosis of AIDS according to the 1993      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria with or without ocular      complications will be enrolled over a 4 year period. Approximately 2,000 patients will be      enrolled in the study. Enrollment of patients with CMV retinitis at baseline will be between      300 and 600 patients. Followup visits for patients without ocular complications will be      scheduled every 6 months. Followup visits for patients with ocular complications at baseline      or diagnosed during followup will be every 3 months. Followup data will include eye      examinations, fundus photographs, visual function testing, medical history, hematology and      serum chemistry, and collection of plasma and blood cells for banking. Analysis of banked      specimens will include HIV RNA levels and CMV DNA levels.    </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">biospec_descr</infon><offset>3661</offset><text>      Laboratory studies will include hematology serum chemistry and lymphocyte subset analysis      for all patients. The amount of blood for hematology, serum chemistry, and lymphocyte subset      analysis is restricted to no more than a total of 17 mL per draw. Data existing on HIV viral      load analysis at the clinic will be collected. If HIV data are not available from medical      records within the visit time window, blood should be collected for local HIV viral load      determination.    </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">study_pop</infon><offset>4172</offset><text>        Patients with a diagnosis of AIDS according to the 1993 CDC diagnostic criteria for AIDS        and diagnosed on or after 01 January 2001 will be eligible for enrollment.      </text></passage><passage><infon key="type">criteria</infon><offset>4359</offset><text>        Inclusion criteria:          -  A diagnosis of AIDS according to the 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention             (CDC) definition (with or without clinical symptoms of CMV retinitis or other ocular             complications of AIDS)          -  Age 13 years or older          -  Signed consent statement          -  Patients with newly diagnosed (within 45 days of enrollment) Ocular Opportunistic             Infections (OOIs)          -  Patients without a newly diagnosed Ocular Opportunistic Infection (OOI) diagnosed             with AIDS after 1 Jan 2001        Exclusion criteria:        - none.      </text></passage></document></collection>
